Netflix Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview
This project presents an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix TV shows and movies dataset. The analysis uncovers key content trends, geographical distribution, and genre preferences, providing insights into the platform's content strategy.

Key Features
Content Type Analysis: Examination of the ratio and distribution of movies versus TV shows on the platform.

Rating and Duration Trends: Analysis of content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14) and the duration of movies and TV shows.

Geographical Distribution: Exploration of content production by country, identifying the primary content hubs.

Genre and Country Insights: Use of heatmaps to visualize the relationship between countries and popular genres, with a focus on normalizing data to reveal subtle regional preferences.

Top Talent: Identification of top actors and directors based on their presence in the dataset.

Key Takeaways
The analysis revealed several key findings about the Netflix catalog:

Geographical Concentration: The catalogue is heavily dominated by content from the US and UK.

Regional Flavors: Normalizing the data highlights distinct regional trends, such as the popularity of Anime in East Asia and Romantic/International films in India.

Audience Focus: The platform's content is heavily skewed toward mature audiences, with a high concentration of TV-MA and TV-14 rated content.

Production Differences: While the US and UK lead in movie production, the TV show landscape is more fragmented, with India emerging as a major contributor.

Future Work
The following areas could be explored to expand on this analysis:

Normalizing the data by each country's total number of titles to better understand relative preferences.

Clustering countries to identify "taste groups" (e.g., countries with similar genre preferences).
